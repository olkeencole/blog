# Biography

I've loved video games from an early age, and as a professional am very interested to see and be involved with how gaming technology will evolve in the future. 

For the past 10 years, I've enjoyed a wide range of responsibilities working at the University of Arkansas and the Tesseract Center that included developing educational games, 3D visualizations, and VR demonstrations. Additional responsibilities include researching new technologies and establishing workflow pipelines with artists and designers. I also mentored programming interns, and taught programming and game development to college students. 

I currently am working on my own game title while providing consultation to those interested in bringing their own ideas to life as an interactive experience in Unity3D. 

I am ever eager to help others learn how to create games and improve on their skillsets. With this goal in mind, I founded and continue to organize the Northwest Arkansas Unity Users Group in Fayetteville, AR. 

If you can't tell, I love working with Unity3D, C# and shaders. But I'm also a huge geek for C++, OpenGL and Vulkan in a bunch of my personal projects.
